# Spirograph calculator

Calculate the number of points on a spirograph pattern
from the number of teeth on the ring and the number of 
teeth on the wheel.

----
Method

Take ring teeth r and difference between ring and wheel (r-w) 
as d.

Find the lowest common multiple LCM of r and d

Divide LCM by d

This is p, the number of points

Example
ring r = 96
wheel w = 52
d = (r - w) = 44
LCM of 96 and 44 is 1056
1056 / 44 = 24

We calculate 24 points for ring 96 and wheel 52
